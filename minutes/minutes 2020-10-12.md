## Agenda items

### ToC Restructuring ([PR#28](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/28))

Comments from Gabriele about Appendix A.2: in case of a router port failure with no LAG, even if the OCh is not affected, the IP Link still needs to be re-configured since the router ports are changed. A similar issue applies to the LAG member in the case of LAG.

This would require some analysis on the YANG models being used to configure the IP Link over a WDM Tunnel, including the configuration of the WDM links.

**Past Actions:**
- [ ] __Gabriele__: check if some IP experts can also join the work\
Pending
- [x] __Italo__: merge both [PR#26](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/26) and [PR#24](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/24) into the master branch\
Done with [PR#28](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/28)
- [ ] __All__: review the text in section 1 and 2 on the master branch (after the merge) and provide comments, opening github issues
- [x] __Italo/Jeff B./Sergio/Paolo__: prepare text proposal for section 3 (Jeff T. volounteered to review)

**Actions:**
- [x] __Gabriele__: Create a new open issue regarding the router port scenario description and propose some text to address it\
Done: Open Issue #29
- [ ] __All__: Please review [PR#28](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/28) before the next bi-weekly call on October 27, 2020

Target: finalize the review and publish this draft as -01 for IETF 109.

Need to share this plan with TEAS WG mailing list.
